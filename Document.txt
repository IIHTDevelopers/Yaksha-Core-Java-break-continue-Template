Assessment Tasks for "Apply Break and Continue Keywords" Topic
Task 1: Print Numbers until a Specific Condition is Met (Break Keyword)
Problem:
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10. If the number is greater than 5, the loop should terminate using the break statement.

Example:

Input:

text
Copy code
None
Output:

text
Copy code
1
2
3
4
5
Explanation:
The program uses a break statement to exit the loop once the number is greater than 5.

Task 2: Skip Even Numbers (Continue Keyword)
Problem:
Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 10, but skips printing even numbers using the continue keyword.

Example:

Input:

text
Copy code
None
Output:

text
Copy code
1
3
5
7
9
Explanation:
The program uses a continue statement to skip over even numbers while printing only the odd numbers.

Task 3: Find First Odd Number Greater than a Given Value (Break Keyword)
Problem:
Write a program that iterates over numbers from 1 to 20 and breaks the loop when the first odd number greater than 15 is found.

Example:

Input:

text
Copy code
None
Output:

text
Copy code
17
Explanation:
The program uses a break statement to exit the loop when the first odd number greater than 15 is found.

Task 4: Skip Specific Number (Continue Keyword)
Problem:
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10, but skips the number 7 using the continue keyword.

Example:

Input:

text
Copy code
None
Output:

text
Copy code
1
2
3
4
5
6
8
9
10
Explanation:
The program uses a continue statement to skip printing the number 7.

Task 5: Print Numbers and Skip Multiples of 3 (Continue Keyword)
Problem:
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 20 but skips printing multiples of 3 using the continue keyword.

Example:

Input:

text
Copy code
None
Output:

text
Copy code
1
2
4
5
7
8
10
11
13
14
16
17
19
20
